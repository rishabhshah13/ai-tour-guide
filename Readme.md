# AI Tour Guide

This project aims to create an AI-powered virtual tour guide that uses a text-to-speech engine to provide informative narrations about various locations and allows users to ask questions about the place they are visiting.

## Features
- Interactive tour guide with text-to-speech capabilities.
- Easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the AI guide.
- Continuous integration and deployment for seamless updates.

### 12-Week Project Timeline

#### Week 1-2: Topic Ideation and Research
- Conduct brainstorming sessions to outline the project scope and features.
- Research existing solutions and technologies for virtual tour guides.

#### Week 3-4: Model Exploration and Selection
- Evaluate TTS models
- Experiment with pre-trained models and select the most suitable ones.

#### Week 5: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System Development
- Webscrape data for various locations
- Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to pull up facts and information in response to user questions.
- Integrate the RAG system with the NLP model to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses.
- Source and preprocess data to be used by the RAG system.

#### Week 6: Backend Development
- Set up the backend framework (Flask/Django).
- Develop RESTful APIs for fetching location data and processing user queries.
- Integrate text-to-speech and NLP models into the backend.

#### Week 7-8: Frontend Development
- Set up the frontend framework (React/Angular).
- Design and implement the user interface for the virtual tour guide.

#### Week 9: Integration and Testing
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs.
- Conduct unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
- Perform user testing sessions to gather feedback.

#### Week 10: Deployment Setup
- Set up cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for deployment.
- Configure continuous integration (CI) pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- Prepare for continuous deployment (CD) to ensure seamless updates.

#### Week 11-12: Final Testing and Documentation
- Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure all features work as expected.
- Monitor application performance and user feedback.
- Make Detailed documentation about the project
